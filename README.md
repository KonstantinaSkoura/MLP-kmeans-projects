This repository contains two assignments as part of a larger project.
Exercise 1: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Sorting
Implement a sorting program using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with three hidden layers. The program components include defining input/output parameters, loading datasets, defining network architecture, implementing forward/backward passes, training with gradient descent, and evaluating generalization ability.

Exercise 2: K-Means Clustering
Implement a clustering program using the k-means algorithm with M groups. The program loads datasets, executes k-means with M centers, stores group centers, calculates clustering error, and plots examples and center positions. Perform multiple runs for M=3,6,9,12 and select the solution with the smallest error.
